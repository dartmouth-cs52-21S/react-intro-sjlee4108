## What Worked Well
* I was able to follow through instruction and understand how react works. I was also able to use api to find videos.

## What Didn't
* Nothing in particular. I was stuck for a bit when I reached daily quota for youtube api.

## Extra Credit
* I also used GIPHY api to show 10 gifs based on the given keyword from search bar. It updates just like how the youtube video search works.
* I used a different data source api. I looked for some fun api to use and found a simple joke api. ([api link](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api)) At the end of the webpage, there is a box that shows a random joke. An user can click the box to get a new joke.
